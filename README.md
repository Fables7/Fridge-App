# Fridge-App
Frontend for my Fridge App

This Fridge app is a hobby app I am creating in order to help reduce food wastage due to food expiring without notice.

This app's goal is to show all items in the Fridge with expiry dates and quantities so there is a central place where one can easily see what the next item 
to expire is.

# Open Food Facts API
This app uses Open Food Facts' api to collect food data from their database, primarily names of products associated to their barcode, any extra information would 
be provided through my app, such as quantity (cheese slices), expiry date, Image, remaining quantity etc
